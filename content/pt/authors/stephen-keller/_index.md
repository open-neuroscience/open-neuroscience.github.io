# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: "Originally from the countryside of São Paulo, I am now a Montréal-based designer and researcher. Over my professional live, I’ve moved between industry and academia, working at advertising agencies, in marketing departments, as a research assistant, and as a freelancer. I eventually moved from Brazil to Canada to pursue a post-graduate diploma in Digital Design, a time that made me interested in research through projects at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction and Data Analytics.

I hold an MA from McGill University, where my thesis explored open science in the context of digital humanities. This work created a commitment in me to foster collaboration, transparency, and public understanding of science, and reinforced the importance of open-data and open-code for improving reproducibility.

Outside of work, you can find me roaming around the city or the woods holding a camera (except during the height of the Canadian summer, when I hibernante until fall), or cooking South Indian curries drenched in tamarind (a by-product of a freelance project that sent me to Chennai for half an year)"
