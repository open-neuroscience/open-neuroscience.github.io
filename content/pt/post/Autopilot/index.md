Autopilot is a Python framework for performing complex, hardware-intensive behavioral experiments with swarms of networked Raspberry Pis. As a tool, it provides researchers with a toolkit of flexible modules to design experiments without rigid programming & API limitations. As a vision, it dreams of bridging the chaotic hacky creativity of scientific programmers with a standardized, communally developed library of hardware control interfaces and reproducible experiment prototypes. Autopilot is supplemented by a semantically-enabled wiki that hosts a library of DIY hardware designs and technical knowledge, use what's there or submit your own: Autopilot is not prescriptive about what hardware you use, and can be extended to handle whatever you want to throw at it.
