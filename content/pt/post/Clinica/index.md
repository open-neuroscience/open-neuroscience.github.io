Clinica is a software platform for clinical research studies involving patients with neurological and psychiatric diseases and the acquisition of multimodal data (neuroimaging, clinical and cognitive evaluations, genetics...), most often with longitudinal follow-up.

Clinica provides tools to convert publicly available neuroimaging datasets into BIDS, namely:
- ADNI: Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative
- AIBL: Australian Imaging, Biomarker & Lifestyle Flagship Study of Ageing
- NIFD: Neuroimaging in Frontotemporal Dementia
- OASIS: Open Access Series of Imaging Studies

Clinica can process any BIDS-compliant dataset with a set of complex processing
pipelines involving different software packages for the analysis of
neuroimaging data (T1-weighted MRI, diffusion MRI and PET data).

Clinica also provides seamless integration between feature extraction and statistics, machine learning or deep learning and is showcased as a framework for reproducible classification of Alzheimer's disease.
