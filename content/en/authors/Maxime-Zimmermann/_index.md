# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: "I was hooked by the Open Source Hardware movement during my Ph.D. in Tom Baden’s lab at the University of Sussex. Having a traditional Biology/Neuroscience background I never had to develop or to rethink the plethora of tools we were using in our routine experiments, and therefore never questioned the limitations of previously established protocols.
Open Source practices allow users to fully understand their equipment and regain the master of their own research projects. And as a consequence, over the years, I conceived several systems which permit the investigation of original scientific questions.
I am now fully engaged into developing scientific equipment and protocols that could overcome the limitation we scientists encounter in our daily tasks and freely exchanging them on Open Access platform to continually upgrading them with the community.
I find in the Open Science movement a proper allegory of the scientific collaboration, as Open Source practices are collective, collaborative and corrective."
