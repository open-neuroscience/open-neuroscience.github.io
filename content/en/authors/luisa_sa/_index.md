# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: "I grew up in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where I became fascinated by the world of neuroscience. While doing research, I quickly became interested in education, science communication and outreach. Working with Open Science then gave me the opportunity to truly contribute to the democratization of scientific knowledge and discoveries.
I am currently the Open Science Community Officer for the Tanenbaum Open Science Institute (TOSI) at The Neuro, in Montréal, Canada. I act also an advisor for the Open Science Office Hours initiative.
I'm a big music fan (mostly rock), I'm always on the move - on foot, on a longboard, or anything with wheels, and I am always willing to spend time in nature and with the people I love."
