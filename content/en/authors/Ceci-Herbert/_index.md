# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: "Being part of a community striving to share, learn and teach others about tools is empowering. And even more so when the focus is to make them accessible and replicable by others, and when individual effort adds towards a greater good. I am quite new to open science and am thrilled to be able to contribute, so I encourage anyone that is interested to take the plunge and get started.

My research interests are in behavioural neuroscience. I have been studying motor control during birdsong production using electrophysiology in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where I'm from. I also play the oboe at a local orchestra and love doing outreach on bioacoustics and how we can visualize sound.
