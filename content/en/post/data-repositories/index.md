In here are some examples of tools that can be used to share/store data collected. Published a paper and think that people would benefit from looking at the raw data? Want to make that data that has been stored for years useful? Here you&#8217;ll find some options on how to do it.

[FigShare](http://figshare.com/about): Free repository that allows storage of any sort of files (data, code, schematics) and gives each of them a digital object identifier (also keeping track to any changes made), which makes them citable. Also the website has tools to share the data.<figure id="attachment_1270" style="width: 167px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

[Dryad](http://datadryad.org/): Repository for data, works in a similar way to Figshare, but Dryad also has a data submission system integrated with a (growing) number of journals, so that paper submissions are synchronized with the data sharing.
