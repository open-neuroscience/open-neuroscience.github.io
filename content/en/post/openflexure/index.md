OpenFlexure is a 3D printed flexure translation stage, developed by a group in Cambridge. The stage is capable of sub-micron-scale motion, with very small drift over time. Which makes it quite good, among other things, for time-lapse protocols that need to be done over days/weeks time, and under space restricted areas, such as fume hoods. A paper describing it in detail can be found [here](http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.05394).

Adding a camera and servo motors, turns the stage into an automated microscope. More details can be found [here](http://www.waterscope.org/3d-printing/).<figure id="attachment_1251" style="width: 243px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
