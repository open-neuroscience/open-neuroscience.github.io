Although of simple complexity and using low currents, this tDCS machine is still to be considered a piece of equipment that could be dangerous both in the assembly and in the operation phases, so please inform yourself as best as you can before either of these steps! Also remember that the openeuroscience website cannot be held responsible for any injuries that might occur from improper use of this tool.
