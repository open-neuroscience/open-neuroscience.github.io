Neurobagel aims to connect decentralized neuroimaging datasets using linked data principles
while allowing data files and access control to remain with research institutes.
The Neurobagel software ecosystem provides reusable data schemas and intuitive tools to:
- annotate phenotypic data using widely adopted, standardized terminology
- integrate harmonized metadata in knowledge graphs based on semantic web standards
- search for and define study cohorts by aggregating participants across datasets
