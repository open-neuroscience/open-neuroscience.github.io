TheBehaviourForum.org (www.thebehaviourforum.com) is a global platform bringing together scientists, technicians, and animal welfare experts to advance the study of animal behaviour. This free, user-friendly space fosters collaboration, enabling members to share knowledge, troubleshoot experiments, and discuss best practices. Topics range from new research findings and experimental protocols to training, conferences, and job opportunities, all with a strong focus on animal welfare and ethical practices.

Whether you're interested in home-cage monitoring, machine-learning tools, preclinical models, ethological studies, or behavioural ecology, TheBehaviourForum.org is tailored for anyone passionate about animal behaviour. By connecting researchers across disciplines—spanning laboratory research, ethology, and ecology—the forum enhances collaboration, refines experiments, and drives innovation in behavioural research.
