GeNN is a GPU enhanced Neuronal Network simulation environment supporting multiple frontends and backends. Spiking neural network models can be specified directly in Python or C++ or through interfaces to Brian 2, SpineCreator (SpineML), or PyNN. GeNN generates optimised code for computational hardware including CPUs and accelerators that are supported through CUDA or OpenCL.
