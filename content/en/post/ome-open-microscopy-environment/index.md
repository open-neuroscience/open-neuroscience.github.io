The [Open Microscopy Environment](https://www.openmicroscopy.org/site) is a collaborative project between several labs. They are developing file formats and software standards for light microscopy.

Within the project they have [BIO-formats](https://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/products/bio-formats), a Java library for reading and writing data. It can be used in [ImageJ](http://openeuroscience.com/software/microscopy/imagej/) (it comes pre-packaged in [FIJI](http://openeuroscience.com/software/microscopy/fiji/)) and matlab.

[OMERO](https://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/products/omero) is a client-server software for storage and data-analysis of microscopy images.
