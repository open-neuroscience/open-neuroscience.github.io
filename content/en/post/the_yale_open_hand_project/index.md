[The Yale open hand project](http://www.eng.yale.edu/grablab/openhand/), has a similar purpose of the open hand project, that is, to make prosthetic hands more widely available through the lowering of costs. They have a different design from the open hand project. Additionally the project wants to take advantage of the lowered costs to speed up the development cycle and provide, together with input from the user community, several different useful hand designs.<figure id="attachment_986" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
