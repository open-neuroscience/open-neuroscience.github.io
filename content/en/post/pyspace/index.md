Various signal processing algorithms (&#8230;) are available within the software, from finite impulse response filters over data-dependent spatial filters (e.g. CSP, xDAWN) to established classifiers (e.g. SVM, LDA). pySPACE incorporates the concept of node and node chains of the Modular Toolkit for Data Processing (MDP) framework.</span></span>
