[Red Pitaya](http://redpitaya.com/?skip_intro=yes) is an computer+FPGA that has digital input and outputs and really fast analog inputs and outputs. It allows connection over ethernet and programming of custom routines. The system is powerful enough to have application in mostly all branches of neuroscience labs: oscilloscopes, signal generators and even a candidate for recording systems.
