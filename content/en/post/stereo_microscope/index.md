Although stereo microscopes are an essential piece of hardware in biology labs, sometimes we wish they had more features, like the possibility to record the magnified images with a camera, or have a better lighting system to enhance contrast on those small samples.

One person has taken those issues to heart and tackled them all in a very brilliant way. Below you&#8217;ll find links to [Steve&#8217;s blog](http://www.tangentaudio.com/about/), where he describes, in a very detailed way, three projects to enhance the all familiar stereo microscope:

Some of them are not that easy to reproduce, but maybe be a good starting point for other DIY versions.
