Nipoppy is a lightweight framework for standardized organization and processing of neuroimaging-clinical datasets. Its goal is to help users adopt the [FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) and improve the reproducibility of studies.

The framework includes three components:
- A protocol for going from raw study data to analysis-ready features.
- A specification for dataset organization that extends the [Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) standard](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/) by providing additional guidelines for tabular (e.g., phenotypic) data and imaging derivatives.
- A command-line interface and Python package that provide user-friendly tools for applying the framework. The tools build upon existing technologies such as the [Apptainer container platform](https://apptainer.org/) and the [Boutiques descriptor framework](https://boutiques.github.io/). Several existing containerized pipelines are supported out-of-the-box, and new pipelines can be added easily by the user.
