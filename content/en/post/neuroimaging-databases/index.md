In here is a small list of databases in the field on neuroimaging:

fMRI related databases:

[OpenfMRI.org](https://openfmri.org/) is a project to make fMRI data freely available. It is hosted by Russ Poldrack at the university of Texas. From the project websit:

> OpenfMRI.org is a project dedicated to the free and open sharing of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets, including raw data.
>
> The most successful current data sharing projects(&#8230;)  are focused primarily on sharing of processed data (&#8230;) The OpenfMRI project differs in that it provides the basis for sharing of complete raw fMRI datasets.
>
> &nbsp;

[Neurosynth](http://neurosynth.org "Statistics: The R environment")  is a wrapper  that “simply” turns paper data into images where brain active regions are mapped and allows for meta-analysis of processed  data. From the project website:

> NeuroSynth is a platform for large-scale, automated synthesis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data extracted from published articles.
>
> The Neurosynth website is essentially just a glorified wrapper around a set of open-source Python and JavaScript packages. In practice, this means you can use the tools we&#8217;ve made available to easily reproduce just about any images or data you find on this website. Most of the tools are hosted in our [GitHub repository](http://github.com/neurosynth).

[Oasis brains](http://www.oasis-brains.org/) is better described by the developers:

> The Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) is a project aimed at making MRI data sets of the brain freely available to the scientific community
>
> OASIS is made available by the Washington University Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center, Dr. Randy Buckner at at Harvard University, the <a href="http://nrg.wustl.edu" target="_blank">Neuroinformatics Research Group (NRG)</a> at Washington University School of Medicine, and the <a href="http://www.nbirn.net" target="_blank">Biomedical Informatics Research Network (BIRN)</a>.**

[Coins](http://coins.mrn.org/), The **Co**llaborative **I**nformatics and **N**euroimaging **S**uite, is a suite developed to allow data storage, sharing and communication among investigators and institutions. Currently the systems allows fMRI, MRI, EEG, ERP, and MEG data to be uploaded
